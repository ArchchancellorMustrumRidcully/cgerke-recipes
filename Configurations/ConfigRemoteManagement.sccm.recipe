	<key>Description</key>
	<string>Creates a cmmac wrapped pkg to enforce remote management with an agent. Requires you to provide a payload.
	See %RECIPE_DIR%/%NAME%/Root/Library/Preferences/com.apple.VNCSettings.txt
	Refer to the recipe launchdaemon to customise the configuration to suit your needs and the preference to
	set your VNC passwrod. In my example I setup Remote Desktop to require the end user to accept an incoming
	connection. You may for example want to the change the allUsers option to limit connections to admin
	users only or even a specific user. This package can also set your VNC password, but right now you will
	need to manually add your HASH to the com.apple.VNCSettings.txt preference as I have not yet
	added a processor to do it for you. Still thinking about how to implement that in a nice way because this
	type of config is very subjective.</string>
