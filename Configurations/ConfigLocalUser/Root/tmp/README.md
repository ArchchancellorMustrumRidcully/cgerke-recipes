# How to

```
/tmp
    /_config
    /_kcpassword.10.x 
```

The “config” file should contain 3 variables:

short_name=
UniqueID=
ShadowHashData=

The kcpassword should be a valid kcpassword file if you wish to have the image perform an autologin. You can add one for each OS as some major versions are different.
