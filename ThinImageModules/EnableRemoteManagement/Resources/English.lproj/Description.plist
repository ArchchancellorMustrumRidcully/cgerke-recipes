	<string>LaunchAgent to enable/configure remote management for Apple Remote Desktop and VNC after every reboot. Refer to the recipe launchdaemon to customise your configuration to suit your needs. In my example I setup Remote Desktop to require the end user to accept an incoming connection. You may for example want to the change the allUsers option to limit connections to admin users only or even a specific user. This package can also set your VNC password, but right now you will need to manually add your HASH to the com.apple.VNCSettings.txt preference as I have not yet added a processor to do it for you. Still thinking about how to implement that in a nice way.</string>
